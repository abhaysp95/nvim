# Neovim

Currently, `nvim` is my primary text editor. I use it from editing config files
to do programming.

**Because I ‚ô•Ô∏è  N/vim**


# üòé Features

I have added many features in the my configuration of text editor. Some of which
I got with the help of other peoples and some sites.

> Colorschemes for my text-editor and my other tools(terminal, bar etc.) are same

You can find my other config files at [my_config_files](https://github.com/coolabhays/my-config-files)

Here, are the main ones:


### üé® Colorscheme

All of the Colorschemes mentioned here are the üèÜ

### Edge
Using [edge](https://github.com/sainnhe/edge)(aura) as main colorscheme. This theme is kinda mixup of `atom one` and `material`. This one works very well in dark as well as light environment and provides good syntax highlighting.

## File browsing

Vim is also known for it's super üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  file browsing.

Overall, fzf makes everytypes of browsing awesome
